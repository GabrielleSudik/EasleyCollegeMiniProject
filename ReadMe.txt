FYI, this project started as an in-class mini project
and it worked (but was simple)
Next day in class you used this for more lessons.

Stuff added:
--data annotations (check models)
--practice migrations
--CHECK THE configuration migration page for notes!
--seeding (check mirga-config)
--navigation properties (briefly)
